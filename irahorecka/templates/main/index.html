    <p>
      My educational background is in biochemistry & molecular biology and I work as a lab automation engineer at a biotech firm.
      I started programming almost 3 years ago and have enjoyed it since.
      I take time to refurbish bicycles and go bass fishing when I'm away from my computer.
